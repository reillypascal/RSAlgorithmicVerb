# RS Algorithmic Verb

Implements a number of different reverb algorithms, including Dattorro's 1997 plate reverb "in the style of Griesinger;" another large concert hall from Dattorro; Gardner's 1992 room reverbs; and the popular "Freeverb" Schroeder reverb. FDN and other options to come.

There is a desaturated magenta rounded rectangle around the knob area.](https://github.com/reillypascal/RSAlgorithmicVerb/assets/94489575/fd7959eb-73e9-4335-b7dd-5f516fd45e06)

## Build Dependencies:
- JUCE (https://juce.com/download/)
- Projucer (https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_new_projucer_project.html) (for creating Xcode/Visual Studio projects in order to build)

<!--Windows:
- Compiled Windows files are available under "Releases". Unzip the files and place them in 
	- C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3 (VST3)
	- C:\Program Files\Common Files\Avid\Audio\Plug-Ins (AAX) 
-->
## macOS:
- Compiled macOS files are available under "Releases". Unzip the files and place them in 
	- Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/ (AU)
	- Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/ (VST3)
<!--	- Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/Avid/Audio/Plug-Ins (AAX) -->
- You will likely need to disable Gatekeeper for the plugins. To do this for AU, type...
```sh
spctl --add "/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/RSAlgorithmicVerb.component"
```

...for VST3...
```sh
spctl --add "/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/RSAlgorithmicVerb.vst3"
```

<!--...or for AAX...
```sh
spctl --add "/Library/Application Support/Avid/Audio/Plug-Ins/RSAlgorithmicVerb.aaxplugin"
```
-->
- You can also add the file path by typing...
```sh
spctl --add 
```

...(with a space at the end) and dragging the plugin file into the terminal, which will automatically add the file path.
